Create a simple Salesforce Expense Tracker app. The code must follow Salesforce best practices and styling standards, and be deployable to a scratch org or sandbox.

- Use a custom object called Expense__c with fields: Name (text), Amount__c (currency), Category__c (picklist: Travel, Food, Supplies).
- Build a Lightning Web Component that lets a user enter an expense and submit it.
- Use Apex to insert the record and return the updated list of expenses.
- Display the list of expenses below the form.
- Add the LWC to a Lightning page and create a tab for the new page. 
- Create an `Expense Tracker` Lighting Experience App and add the custom object tab and Lighting page tab to the App.
- Create a new permission set that provides full access to the application, custom object and all of their custom fields.
- Assign the permission set
